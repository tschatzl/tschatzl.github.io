Garbage First's (G1) collector's throughput sometimes trails that of other HotSpot VM collectors by up to 20% (e.g. [JDK-8253230](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8253230) or [JDK-8132937](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8132937)). The difference is caused by G1's principle to be a garbage collector that keeps a balance between latency and throughput and meets a pause time goal. A large part can be attributed to the synchronization of garbage collector with the application necessary to allow correct concurrent work. With [JDK-8340827](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8340827) we substantially redesign how the synchronization works for much less impact on throughput. This post explains these fairly fundamental changes.

Another sources with more information are the corresponding [draft JEP](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8340827) and the [implementation PR](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8340827).

## Background

G1 is an incremental garbage collector. During garbage collection, a large part of time can be spent on trying to find references to live objects in the areas of the application heap (just *heap* in the following) to evacuate them. The most simple and probably slowest way would be to look through (scan) the entire heap that is not going to be evacuated for such references. The stop-the-world Hotspot collectors, Serial, Parallel and G1 in principle employ a fairly old technique called Card Marking [[HÃ¶lzle93](https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/write-barrier.pdf)] to limit the area to scan for references during the garbage collection pause.

In its attempt to better keep pause times, G1 extended this card marking mechanism:
* concurrent to the application G1 re-examines (**refines**) the cards marked by the application and classifies them. This classification helps in the garbage collection pause to only need to scan cards important for that particular garbage collection.
* extra code compiled into the application (**write barriers**) removes unnecessary card marks, reducing the amount of cards to scan further.

This comes at additional cost as the next few sections will show.

### Card Marking in G1

Card Marking divides the heap into fixed-size chunks called **cards**. Every card is represented as a byte in a separate fixed-size array called a **card table**. Each entry corresponds to a small area, typically 512 bytes, in the heap. A card may either be marked or unmarked, a mark indicating the potential presence of interesting references in the heap corresponding to the card. An **interesting reference** for garbage collection is a reference that refers from an area in the heap that is not going to be garbage collected to one that is.

When the application modifies an object reference, additional code compiled into application, the write barrier, intercepts the modification and marks the corresponding card in the card table.

![Card marking](/assets/20250214-write-barrier-assignment.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Figure 1 above shows an example execution of a hypothetical assignment of the field `a` in an object `x` of type `X` with a value of `y`. After writing the value into the field, the write barrier code (to be exact, *post write barrier* code, i.e. code added after setting the value) marks the card.

This is where the Serial and Parallel garbage collectors stop at: they let the application accumulate card marks until garbage collection occurs. At that time all of the heap corresponding to the marked cards is scanned for references into the evacuated area. In most applications this is okay effort: the amount of unique cards that need to be scanned during garbage collection is very limited. In other applications scanning the heap corresponding to cards (**scanning the cards**) can take a very significant amount of total garbage collection time.

G1 tries to reduce this amount of card scanning in the garbage collection pause by several means. The first is using extra garbage collection threads running concurrent to the application clearing, re-examining and classifying card marks because:
* references are often written over and over again between garbage collections. A card mark caused by a reference write may, by the time the next garbage collection occurs, not contain any interesting reference any more.
* by classifying card marks according to where they originate from, it is possible to only scan marked cards that are relevant for this particular garbage collection during the garbage collection.

Figure 2, 3 and 4 give details about this re-examination (**refinement*) process.

![Store Cards in Buffer](/assets/20250214-storing-card-in-buffer.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

First, Figure 2 shows that in addition to the actual card mark mentioned above, the write barrier stores (**enqueues**) the card location (in this case `0xabc`) in an internal buffer (**refinement buffer**) shown in green so that the re-examination garbage collector threads (**refinement threads**) can later easily find them again.

There is an artificial delay based on available time in the pause for scanning cards and the rate the application generates new marked cards between card mark and refinement. This delay helps decreasing the overhead of an application repeatedly marking the same cards, avoiding that the same cards will be repeatedly enqueued for refinement (as they are already marked). The delay also increases the probability that the references in the card itself are not interesting any more.

In the next step, shown in Figure 3, refinement threads will pick up previously enqueued cards for re-examination. In this case, the card at location `0xdef` will be refined. The figure also shows the **remembered sets** in light blue: for every area to evacuate, G1 stores the set of interesting card locations for this area. In this figure every area has such a remembered set attached to it, but there may not be one currently for some. Areas may also be discontiguous in the heap. The refinement thread also unmarks the card before looking at the corresponding contents of the Java heap.

![Card Refinement](/assets/20250214-re-examining-card.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Figure 4 finally shows the step where the refinement threads put the examined card (`0xdef`) into the remembered sets of the areas for which that card contains an interesting reference at this point in time. Since the heap covered by a card may contain multiple interesting references, multiple remembered sets may receive that particular card location.

![Clearing and Classification](/assets/20250214-clearing-and-classifying-card.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

The end result of this fairly complicated process is that compared to the other throughput collectors in the Hotspot VM in the garbage collection pause G1 only needs to scan cards from two sources:
* cards just recently marked dirty by the application and not yet refined.
* cards from the remembered sets of areas that are about to be collected from the remembered sets.

G1 will merge these two sources, marking cards from the remembered sets on the card table, before scanning these cards [[JDK-8213108](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8213108)].

Depending on the application this can result in a significant reduction of time spent in card scanning during garbage collection compared to regular card marking.

### Write Barrier in G1

Barriers are small pieces of code that are executed to coordinate between the application and the VM. Garbage collection extensively uses them to intercept changes in memory. The Serial, Parallel and G1 garbage collectors use, write barriers on writes to references, i.e. every time the application writes a value into a reference. The VM executes additional code the vicinity of that write.

![Pre- and Post-Write Barrier](/assets/20250217-pre-post-write-barrier.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

The figure above visualizes this: for a write of the value `y` into a field `x.a`, next to the actual write, code unrelated to the write used for synchronization with the garbage collector is executed; Serial and Parallel GC only have a **post-write barrier** (after the write), while G1 has both pre- and post-write barriers (before and after the write). G1 uses the pre-write barrier for unrelated matters to this discussion, so the following text will just use "write barrier" or just "barrier".

The previous section hinted at the responsibilities of the write barrier in G1:
* mark the card as dirty
* store the card location in refinement buffers if the card has not been marked yet

This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately there is some complication that Figure 5 shows: both the application and the refinement threads might write to the same card at the same time. The former marking it, the latter clearing it. This might result in lost updates to the remembered sets where the refinement thread would observe the card mark but not observe the write of the value without additional precautions. This requires some fairly costly memory synchronization in the write barrier.

![Concurrency Issues](/assets/20250217-concurrency-problem.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Additionally, concurrent refining of cards can be expensive, particularly if there are no extra processing resources available. So the G1 barrier contains extra filtering code to avoid card marks that are generated by reference writes that make no difference for garbage collection.

The G1 write barrier will not mark a card if
* the reference assignment write a reference that is not interesting, not crossing areas.
* the code assigns a `null` value: these do not generate links between objects, so corresponding marked card are unnecessary.
* the card is already marked, which means that it is already scheduled for refinement.

Figure 6 compares the sizes of the resulting, directly inlined part of the G1 write barrier (there is an additional part not shown here which is executed somewhat rarely) on the left with the whole Serial and Parallel GC write barrier on the right ([[Protopopovs23](https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/MasterTheses/Protopopovs/Thesis.pdf)]).

![Write Barrier Comparison](/assets/20250217-post-write-barrier-fast-path.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Without going into detail, instead of three (x86-64) instructions, the G1 write barrier takes around 50 instructions. The bars to the left of the G1 write barrier roughly correspond to above tasks: blue for the filters, green for the memory synchronization and the actual card mark, and orange for storing the card in the refinement buffers for the refinement threads

### Impact

G1 uses a large write barrier with many mechanisms to minimize performance impact of the memory synchronization necessary for correctness and overhead of concurrent work.

All the effort to reduce memory synchronization is wasted if the application's memory access pattern does not fit them and actually performs lots of fairly random reference assignments across the whole heap which to a large part result in enqueuing of card locations for later refinement like BigRAMTester [[JDK-8152438](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8152438)].

The other poor fit for this write barrier are applications that execute the write barrier in tight loops and at the same time extremely rarely generate a card mark with interesting references so that no concurrent refinement is necessary or actually ever performed (e.g. [JDK-8253230](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8253230)). These are hampered by the large code footprint of the barrier, inhibiting compiler optimizations.

## A New Approach

Previous sections showed that a large part of the G1 write barrier is required by the per-card mark memory synchronization to guarantee correctness in case of concurrent writes to the card table and storing the card locations for subsequent refinement.

To remove the memory synchronization, similar to ZGC's double-buffered remembered sets [[JEP439](https://openjdk.org/jeps/439)], this new approach uses two card tables. Each set of threads, the application threads and the refinement threads, gets assigned their own card table, each initially completely empty. Each set of threads only ever writes different values to their card table (just "card table" and "**refinement table***"), obviating the need for fine-grained memory synchronization during actual card mark.

Similar to before there is a heuristic that tracks card mark rate on the application card table, and if heuristics predict that there are too many card marks on that card table to meet pause time goal, swap the card tables atomically to the application. The application continues to mark its card table (previously the refinement table), while garbage collection refinement threads work to re-examine all marks from the previous application card table.

This removes the need for memory synchronization in the G1 write barrier.

Additionally, the refinement table is directly used as storage for the to-be-refined marked cards, given that finding the marked cards is not prohibitively expensive.

This removes the need for the write barrier code to store the card locations in refinement buffers.

### New Card Marking in G1

Figure 7 shows this new arrangement of data structures: there are now two card tables, the write barrier as before marks the card on its (application) card table.

![Card Marking (New)](/assets/20250217-new-write-barrier-assignment.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

When the card table accrued enough marks, G1 switches card tables atomically. Figure 8 shows an example where the application card table and the refinement table were just switched, and the application already continued marking cards on the former refinement card table.

![Switching Card Tables](/assets/20250217-switching-card-tables.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Refinement threads start re-examining cards from the refinement card table (previously application card table) as before as indicated. Card marks are cleared until all marked cards have been processed. Since the application threads continue to mark cards on their card table, no synchronization between application threads and refinement threads is required.

### New Write Barrier in G1

At minimum, the new G1 write barrier requires the card mark, similar to Parallel GC. The difference is that unlike in the Parallel GC write barrier, the card table base address is not constant as it might change for G1 after every card table switch. So Parallel GC can inline the card table address into the code stream, G1 needs to reload it every time from thread local storage.

The final current post write barrier for G1 reduces to the filters and the actual card mark. For a given assignment `x.a = y`, the VM now adds the following pseudo-code after the assignment:

```
(1)  if (region(x.a) == region(y)) goto done;    // Ignore references within the same region/area
(2)  if (y == nullptr) goto done;                // Ignore null writes
(3)  if (card(x.a) != Clean) goto done;          // Ignore if the card is non-clean
(4)
(5)  *card(x.a) = Dirty;                         // Mark the card
(6) done:
```

Line (1) to (3) implement the filters. They are almost the same as before, with a slightly different condition for the check due to a memory optimization.

Without the filters, there were some regressions compared to the original write barrier with the filters; the filters also decrease the number of cards that have not been scanned during the garbage collection pause, and the amount of cards to be re-examined, so they were kept for now.

Line (5) actually marks the card with a "Dirty" color value.
 
The original card marking paper uses two different values for card table entries, i.e. colors: "Marked" and "Unmarked", or typically named "Dirty" and "Clean" in the Hotspot VM. In total G1 uses five colors which store some additional information about the corresponding heap area:

* **clean** - the card does not contain an interesting reference.
* **dirty** - the card may contain an interesting reference.
* **already-scanned** - used during garbabge collection to indicate that this card has already been scanned.
* **to-collection-set** - the card may contain an interesting reference to the heap areas that are going to be collected in the next garbage collection (the **collection set**, hence the name). This collection set always contains the young generation.

    Refinement can skip scanning these cards because it will always be scanned during garbage collection because G1 always collects the young generation. Adding this card to the remembered sets is not needed, it would actually be duplicate information.

    For simplicity in the write barrier, it only colors cards as "Dirty": the additional overhead in finding out whether this has been a reference to an object in the collection set is too expensive here.
* **from-remset** - used during garbage collection to indicate that the origin of this card is a remembered set and not a recently marked card. This helps distinguishing cards from remembered sets from cards from not yet examined cards to more accurately model the application's card marking rate used in heuristics.

The last two card colors are new. The use of the to-collection-set color explains the condition used in line (3) of the write barrier above: it avoids overwriting this value excluding benign races.

### Switching the Card Tables and Refinement

The goal of the card table switching process is to make sure that all threads in the system agree on that the refinement table is now the application card table and the other way around to avoid the problematic situation described earlier in Figure 5.

The process is initiated by a special background thread, the refinement control thread. It regularly estimates whether the currently estimated amount of cards at the start of the next garbage collection would exceed the allowed number of not re-examined cards given card examination rate. If a refinement round is necessary, it also calculates the number of refinement worker threads, which do the actual work, needed to complete before the garbage collection.

This refinement round consists of

1. **Swap references** to the card tables. This includes global card table pointers that newly created VM threads and VM runtime calls use, and every internal thread's local copy of the current reference to the application card table. This step uses thread local handshakes ([JEP 312](https://openjdk.org/jeps/312)) and a similar technique for VM internal, mostly garbage collector related, threads.

    This ensures correct memory visibility: After this step, the entire VM uses the previous refinement table to mark new cards.

1. **Snapshot the heap** to gather internal data about the refinement work. For every region of the heap the snapshot stores current progress. This allows resuming the refinement at any time.

1. **Re-examine (sweep) the refinement table** containing the marked cards. Refinement worker threads walk the card table linearly (hence sweeping), claiming parts of it to look for marked cards.

    As Figure 9 shows, the refinement threads re-examine marked cards, with the following potential results:

    ![Refinement Threads Re-Examining Cards](/assets/20250217-refinement-reexamine-without-sync.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

    * Cards with references to the collection set are not added to any remembered set. The refinement thread marks these cards as to-collection-set in the application card table and skips any further refinement.
    * If the card is already marked as to-collection-set, the refinement thread will re-mark this card on the application card table and not examine the corresponding heap contents.
    * Dirty cards which corresponding Java heap can not be parsed right now will be forwarded to the application card table as dirty.
    * Interesting references in heap areas corresponding to dirty cards cause that card to be added to the remembered sets.
    * During card examination, the card is always set to clean on the refinement card table. Parts of the refinement card table corresponding to the collection set are simply cleaned without re-examination as this is not necessary. During evacuation of these regions, the references of live objects will be found implicitly.

    Writing directly to the application card table by the refinement threads is safe: apart from benign memory races with the application, the result will be at worst another dirty card mark without the additional information.
1. **Calculate statistics** about the recent refinement and update predictors.

Any of these steps may be interrupted by a safepoint, which may be a garbage collection pause that evacuates memory.

### Garbage Collection and Refinement

Refinement heuristics try to avoid having garbage collection interrupt refinement. In this case, the refinement table is all unmarked at the start of the garbage collection, and all the not-yet examined marked cards are on the main card table where the following card table scan phase expects them. No further action except putting the remembered sets of areas to be collected on the main card table must be taken to be able to search for marked cards efficiently on the card table.

Previously G1 had information about the location of all marked cards, they were either in the remembered sets, or in the refinement buffers to refine cards. Based on this, G1 could create a more detailed map of where marked cards were located, and only search those areas for marked cards instead of searching the whole card table. However searching for marked cards is linear access to a relatively little area of memory, so very fast.

The absence of more precise location information for marked cards is also offset by not needing to calculate this information.

In the common case of garbage collections with only young generation areas to evacuate, there is nothing to do as the young generation area's remembered set are effectively tracked on the card table.

If a young garbage collection pause occurs at any point during the refinement process, the garbage collection needs to perform some compensating work for the not yet swept parts of the refinement table.

In this case the G1 garbage collector there is a new `Merge Refinement Table` phase that performs a subset of the refinement process:

![Merge Refinement Table](/assets/20250221-merge-refinement-table.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

1. (Optionally) **Snapshot the heap** as above, if the refinement had been interrupted in phase 1 of the process.
1. **Merge the refinement table** into the card table. This steps combines card marks from both card tables into the main card table. This is a logical or of both cards. All marks on the refinement table are removed.
1. **Calculate statistics** as above.

The reason why the refinement table needs to be completely unmarked at the start of the garbage collection is that G1 uses it to  collect card marks containing interesting references for objects evacuated during the garbage collection in the heap areas the objects are evacuated to. This is similar to previously used extra refinement buffers to store those.

At the end of the young garbage collection, the two card tables are swapped so that all newly generated cards are on the main card table, and the refinement table is all unmarked.

A full collection clears both card tables as this type of garbage collection does not need this information.

## Performance Impact

This section contains some information about the aspects throughput, (native) memory footprint and latency compared to before these changes.

### Throughput

In summary, throughput improves significantly
* for applications that execute the write barrier in full often because of the removal of the fine-grained synchronization in the barrier. Another aspect is that the new write barrier also significantly reduces refinement overhead because finding marked cards is faster (linear search vs. random access). There are also savings here due to reducing refinement work by keeping the young generation remembered set on the card table as these cards are at most re-examined once.
* due to reduced cost/size of the write barrier enables better performance, either due to better optimization in the compiler or due to being easier to execute.

Throughput improvements may manifest as reductions in Java heap memory usage.

The extent of the improvements can differ by microarchitecture. Parallel GC is still slightly ahead, there is more work going on reducing this difference further.

### Native Memory Footprint

The additional card table takes 0.2% of Java heap size compared to JDK 21 and above. In JDK 21 one card table sized data structure has been removed, so JDKs before that do not show that difference.

Some of that additional memory is offset by removal of the refinement buffers for card locations. Additionally, memory usage is reduced by keeping the collection set's remembered set on the card table, taking no extra space.

The optimization to color these remembered set entries specially keeps duplicates appearing in the other remembered sets, also reducing native memory.

In some applications these memory reductions completely offset the additional card table memory usage, but this is fairly rare. Particularly applications that did not have large remembered sets for the young generation, which are mostly very throughput-oriented applications, show the above mentioned additional memory usage.

The refinement table is only required if the applications needs to do any refinement. So the refinement table could be allocated lazily, i.e. only if there is some refinement. There is a large overlap between such applications and above very throughput-oriented applications.

This is not implemented in the current version.

### Latency, Pause Times

Pause times are not affected, if not tending to be slightly faster. Pause times typically decrease due to a shorter "Merge remembered sets" phase as due to no work required for the remembered sets for the young generation in the common case - they are always already on the card table.

Even if the refinement table needs to be merged into the card table it is extremely fast and is always faster than merging remembered sets for the young gen in my measurements. This work is linearly scanning some memory instead of many random writes, so this is embarassingly parallel.

The cards created during garbage collection do not need to be redirtied, so that phase has also been removed.

## Summary

This change removes the need for a large part of G1's write barrier using a dual card table approach to avoid fine-grained synchronization, increasing throughput significantly for applications.

Overall I'm quite satisfied with the change - after many years thinking about and prototyping solutions to the problem without introducing some "G1 throughput mode" that would have huge implications on maintainability (basically another garbage collector) or making G1 unnecessarily complex this seems a very good solution, taking the advantages of these throughput barriers without too many drawbacks.

A lot of people helped with this change, my thanks.
